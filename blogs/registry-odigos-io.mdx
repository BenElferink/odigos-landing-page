Odigos images are now available at a new location: `registry.odigos.io`.

Starting in Odigos v1.0.155, all component images will pull from `registry.odigos.io` instead of DockerHub. We have decided to migrate from DockerHub to our own hosted registry to serve our users directly and without pull limits imposed by DockerHub.

What this means is that you can now install Odigos without configuring DockerHub credentials or pull secrets in your cluster.

In addition, Odigos images will no longer have a `keyval/` prefix. For example, in v1.0.154 the Odiglet image `docker.io/keyval/odigos-odiglet:v1.0.154` is now `registry.odigos.io/odigos-odiglet:v1.0.155`.

For users that are currently re-hosting images in their own registry (and installing with a custom `--image-prefix`), please note our new [instructions for installing Odigos from a custom Docker registry](https://docs.odigos.io/setup/docker-registry) and ensure your image tags match the new format.
