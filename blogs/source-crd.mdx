We are excited to announce a change to the way you control
instrumented workloads with Odigos: Source objects.

Beginning in Odigos v1.0.144, the new Source object is a Custom
Resource that allows declarative control over which workloads and
namespaces are instrumented in your cluster. This is an evolution from
the current approach in which you enable or disable instrumentation by
setting the `odigos-instrumentation=enabled` label directly on your
workload.

An example Source object looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: my-source
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: my-app
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
```

With these objects, we can provide the same functionality and control that's offered today with several benefits, which we'll explain below.

But first, a few things to note:

- **Sources are namespaced objects**, created in the same namespace as
  the workload they represent. This gives application teams the
  independence to own their own instrumentation as well as providing
  flexible RBAC control for system admin, DevOps, and SRE teams.
- **Sources identify a workload by name, namespace, and kind.** This
  allows Odigos to uniquely identify the workload to be
  instrumented. In the future, we hope to add wider identification
  capabilities such as LabelSelectors to allow you to define custom
  application topologies.
- **Sources are entirely decoupled from applications.** Instrumenting
  a workload with Sources means that there is no change required to
  the workload's definition. This allows Sources to persist beyond
  the lifecycle of a workload, idempotently enabling workload
  instrumentation even if it is deleted and re-deployed.
- **Sources exist 1:1 with applications.** Only one Source can exist
  for each workload (except in the case of namespace instrumentation
  â€“ more on that later).
- **Source workload fields are immutable once created.** When a Source
  is linked to a workload, it is linked to that workload forever
  (until the Source is deleted).

## Why this change?

In Odigos today, instrumenting your applications is as simple as
applying a label to a workload or namespace. So why make the switch to
a resource?

While the simplicity of instrumentation labels is certainly
beneficial, this approach also has its drawbacks. When talking to
users about this, some issues became clear:

- Using a label on the workload creates a stateful relationship on the
  workload's definition, meaning that if the workload is modified then
  care must be taken to persist the label for instrumentation to
  remain effective. This causes problems with continuous deployment
  systems that might overwrite labels by default. It also means that
  distributed teams need to be aware of their auto-instrumentation,
  which shouldn't be a concern for them.
- Relying on the label's value means that our backend needs to not
  only monitor the presence of the label, but also changes to its
  value. This creates an edge-based system that is difficult for
  Kubernetes operators to resiliently consume at scale.
- Kubernetes labels are intended for identifying and grouping
  workloads, not as a control mechanism. In contrast, CRDs are a
  common config pattern for users to interact with Kubernetes
  operators.

Switching to a resource-based control mechanism addresses these by
leveraging idiomatic Kubernetes operator patterns to reconcile the
state of the cluster in a truly level-based design. It creates a
user-facing config surface to declare the desired state of the cluster
through a persistent and reliable Source of truth.

With Sources, you are declaring that a workload (or namespace) should
be instrumented, _forever_, as long as that Source exists. This means
the workload can be deleted, re-deployed, or modified in any way and
Odigos will still continue to recognize it.

This decoupled persistence is critical to the role of Odigos as a
low-overhead, non-invasive tool for auto-instrumentation.

## How to use sources?

Functionally, Source objects provide full feature parity with the
auto-instrumentation controls in Odigos today. That includes:

- Instrumenting individual workloads
- Instrumenting entire namespaces
- Excluding individual workloads from namespace instrumentation

### Instrumenting individual workloads

Say you have a simple app consisting of two deployments: `frontend`
and `backend`. To instrument both of these, you will create two Source
objects:

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: frontend
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
---
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: backend
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: backend
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
```

When these objects are created, Odigos will find these workloads,
detect their runtimes, and automatically instrument them just as it
does today.

You can confirm that these Sources were created with `kubectl`:

```
$ kubectl get sources
NAME      WORKLOAD  KIND        NAMESPACE
frontend  frontend  Deployment  default
backend   backend   Deployment  default
```

### Instrumenting entire namespaces

Instrumenting an entire namespace is similar to instrumenting
individual workloads, except it only requires one Source object for
the entire namespace. Following the above example, that would be:

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: myapp-namespace
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: default
    namespace: default
    kind: Namespace
```

In this case, a Source object must set kind: Namespace with the name
and namespace equal to the namespace to instrument. This will
instrument all of the possible workloads in the namespace under the
single Source:

```
$ kubectl get sources
NAME            WORKLOAD  KIND      NAMESPACE
myapp-namespace default   Namespace default
```

You can also create an individual workload Source in the same
namespace. For example, you could also create the above frontend
Source, and the list for the namespace would now look like this:

```
$ kubectl get sources
NAME            WORKLOAD  KIND        NAMESPACE
myapp-namespace default   Namespace   default
frontend        default   Deployment  default
```

Doing so will keep the `frontend` deployment instrumented even if the
`myapp-namespace` Source is deleted.

### Excluding individual workloads from namespace instrumentation

Similar to the last example, a Source can exclude individual workloads
from namespace-wide instrumentation. This is done by setting
`disableInstrumentation: true` on the Source.

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: backend-excluded
  namespace: default
spec:
  disableInstrumentation: true
  workload:
    name: backend
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
```

Now, if the namespace is instrumented, the backend deployment will not
be instrumented (as long as the Source is present).

## Working with Sources

When a Source object is created, Odigos will automatically apply
labels to that Source that mirror the `workload` field. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: backend
  namespace: default
  labels:
    odigos.io/workload-name: backend # added automatically
    odigos.io/workload-namespace: default # added automatically
    odigos.io/workload-kind: Deployment # added automatically
spec:
  workload:
    name: backend
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
```

This is intended to provide flexible management of Sources using
native Kubernetes LabelSelectors:

```
$ kubectl get sources -l odigos.io/workload-kind=Deployment
NAME      WORKLOAD  KIND        NAMESPACE
frontend  frontend  Deployment  default
backend   backend   Deployment  default
```

This approach was chosen to support older versions of Kubernetes that
do not yet have default support for [selectable
fields](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#crd-selectable-fields).

As mentioned earlier, keep in mind that Sources are immutable and must
exist 1:1 with the workload or namespace they instrument. Odigos will
validate both of these on creation and any attempts to update existing
Sources.

## Continued support for label-based instrumentation

As mentioned above, the current support for label-based
instrumentation is convenient and we understand that some users may
prefer it. While we encourage users to migrate to Source objects, we
will continue to provide support for the current label-based approach
as a shorthand method for creating Sources.

Going forward, when Odigos finds a workload or namespace that is
labeled with `odigos-instrumentation=enabled`, the backend will automatically
create a matching Source object.

This operation is idempotent, meaning that re-creating the same
workload with `odigos-instrumentation=enabled` will not create a new Source
object if one already exists for that workload.

Similarly, labeling a workload or namespace with
`odigos-instrumentat=disabled` will create a Source for that workload
with `disableInstrumentation: true`.

However, both of these actions will log a warning in the Instrumentor.

## Future plans

While Source objects today are functionally simply a way to enable or
disable instrumentation, in the future we plan to expand this object
to provide more functionality such as:

- LabelSelector-based workload selection
- Source-to-destination grouping configuration
- Instrumentation status conditions

With features like these in mind, we plan for Sources to be the main
user-facing Kubernetes resource within Odigos going forward.
