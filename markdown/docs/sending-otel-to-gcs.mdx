In this blog post, we will show you how to send OpenTelemetry data to Google Cloud Storage using Odigos.

Since version v0.1.4, Odigos supports sending OpenTelemetry data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). For the first time, you can use storage services like GCS to store your OpenTelemetry data, and build custom solutions on top of it.

## Creating a GCS bucket

First, you need to create a GCS bucket. You can do it using the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) or using the [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) command line tool. For example, to create a bucket named `otel-data` in the `us-central1` region, run the following command:

```console
gsutil mb -p <project-id> -c regional -l us-central1 gs://otel-data
```

## Creating a GKE cluster

Next, you need to create a GKE cluster with permissions to write to GCS. You can do it using the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list) or using the [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) command line tool. For example, to create a cluster named `otel-cluster` in the `us-central1` region, run the following command (replace `PROJECT_ID` with your project ID):

```console
gcloud container clusters create otel-cluster \
--region us-central1 \
--workload-pool=PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog
```

## Installing demo application

For this demo, we will use the [emojivoto](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/emojivoto) application. You can install it by running the following command:

```console
kubectl apply -k kubectl apply -k github.com/keyval-dev/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation/docs/getting-started/emojivoto
```

## Installing Odigos

After installing the demo application, you need to install Odigos to send data to GCS.
The simplest way to install Odigos is via the helm chart by executing the following commands:

```console
helm repo add odigos https://keyval-dev.github.io/odigos-charts/
helm install my-odigos odigos/odigos --namespace odigos-system --create-namespace
```

## Granting permissions using workload identity

To grant permissions to the cluster, you need to create a service account and bind it to the cluster. You can do it using the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) or using the [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) command line tool. For example, to create a service account named `otel-sa` and bind it to the cluster, run the following commands:

```console
gcloud iam service-accounts create otel-sa
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  --role roles/storage.objectCreator \
  --member "serviceAccount:otel-sa@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  otel-sa@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Finally, you need to bind the `odigos-gateway` service account to the GCP service account, run the following command:

```console
kubectl annotate serviceaccount -n odigos-system odigos-gateway \
  iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=otel-sa@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

## Sending data to GCS

The last step is to configure Odigos to send data to GCS. This can be done easily by accessing the Odigos UI and creating a new Google Cloud Storage destination. Make sure to specify the bucket name you created earlier.

## Summary

In this blog post, we showed you how to send OpenTelemetry data to Google Cloud Storage using Odigos, an open-source observability control plane. Odigos supports more that 20 different destinations, including cloud providers like Azure and Google Cloud, as well as open-source solutions like Loki, Elasticsearch, and Prometheus.
