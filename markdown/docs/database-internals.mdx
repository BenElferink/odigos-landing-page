Traditional monitoring tools often provide only surface-level insights into database internals, leaving gaps between client applications and database servers. Odigos bridges this divide by leveraging **eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** technology, offering unparalleled real-time insights that connect client and server activities in a single, cohesive trace.

> Note: These features are available in the Enterprise Edition of Odigos.

## The Power of eBPF in Database Monitoring

**eBPF** allows programs to run directly in the Linux kernel space, enabling deeper system-level observability with minimal overhead. Odigos leverages this power to provide next-level database monitoring. Here’s how **Odigos powered by eBPF** stacks up against traditional monitoring methods:

| **Aspect**                    | **Traditional Monitoring**             | **eBPF with Odigos**                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Overhead**                  | Often high with detailed logging       | Minimal, thanks to efficient kernel-level operation    |
| **Flexibility**               | Limited to predefined metrics          | Highly flexible, captures custom events                |
| **Depth of Insight**          | Application-level only                 | Kernel-level insights available                        |
| **Dynamic Updates**           | Often requires restarts                | Can be updated on-the-fly                              |
| **Code Modifications**        | May require code changes or agents     | Non-intrusive, no code changes needed                  |
| **Real-time Visibility**      | Often delayed or batched               | Immediate, real-time insights                          |
| **Client-Server Correlation** | Typically separate, disconnected views | Unified traces connecting client and server activities |

## Odigos: A Deep Dive into Database Internals

Odigos leverages eBPF to provide comprehensive insights into MySQL and PostgreSQL internals. Here are the key features that make Odigos stand out in database monitoring:

### **Query-Related Monitoring**

1. **Query Capture and Analysis with Client Context**- **Feature**: Real-time SQL query interception with client-side correlation

- **How it Works**: eBPF probes intercept queries at both the client application and database engine levels
- **Insights Gained**:
  - Full visibility into executed SQL queries with originating client context
  - Performance metrics paired with query text and client-side operations
  - Identification of frequent and problematic queries linked to specific client action

1. **Query Execution Tracing**
   - **Feature**: Detailed query execution pipeline analysis
   - **How it Works**: probes trace key functions in query execution
   - **Insights Gained**:
     - Timing breakdowns of query stages (parsing, planning, execution)
     - Correlation between queries and their execution metrics
     - Identification of bottlenecks in query processing

### **Resource-Related Monitoring**

1. **I/O Operations Monitoring**
   - **Feature**: Real-time I/O tracking
   - **How it Works**: eBPF programs trace I/O-related system calls
   - **Insights Gained**: End-to-end visibility into database file operations, network communication, and client-side I/O
2. **Lock Contention Detection**
   - **Feature**: Identification of locking issues
   - **How it Works**: eBPF probes attach to locking functions
   - **Insights Gained**: Detection of lock contention and its impact on performance

3. **Resource Utilization Tracking**
   - **Feature**: Granular resource usage monitoring
   - **How it Works**: eBPF monitors CPU, memory, and I/O at a low level
   - **Insights Gained**: Correlation between database operations and resource consumption
