In this blog post, we will describe how and why we setup the `ko` build tool to deploy our Go microservices in our Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- You have a Go project you want to build into a docker image and deploy
- You heard about ko and are looking for reference on how it is being used in practice

I'll explain how we integrate `ko` with `k8s`. If you are deploying using a different platform, this blog will still be helpful in understanding how to integrate ko workflow in your stack.

## Why `ko`?

At [Keyval](https://keyval.dev/), the backend of our service is built as a set of microservice applications written in Go. We use `Kubernetes` in `EKS` - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service.

`ko` gives us the following benefits:

- No need to craft and maintain Dockerfiles for each microservice
- Images built by `ko` follow container image build best practices, producing more secure, smaller size minimal images
- Integrates well with our kubernetess workflow, and with just one command line can:
  - Build images
  - Push them to our private repository
  - Update the relevant "image:" values in our k8s manifest `.yaml` files
  - Apply them to our cluster.

## Useful

### Links

- [Install `ko` CLI](https://ko.build/install/)
- [Docs](https://ko.build/)
- [Github repo](https://github.com/ko-build/ko)
- [Github action for CI](https://github.com/ko-build/setup-ko)

### Verify Installation

```sh
$ ko version
```

Should produce an output.

### Search Online

If you google or chat-gpt `ko`, you might want to append `build` to your search query, as `ko` is a very common word. For example, use "`ko build getting started`" (instead of just `ko getting started`)

### CLI Help

Like many other tools, you can find most of what you need directly from the CLI help flag, without switching context:

```
$ ko version
0.14.1
$ ko
Rapidly iterate with Go, Containers, and Kubernetes.

Usage:
  ko [flags]
  ko [command]

Available Commands:
  apply       Use resolved references in input files for image digest application.
  build       Build and publish container images from the given import paths.
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  create      Generate input files with resolved image references.
  delete      See "kubectl help delete" for detailed usage.
  help        Help about any command
  login       Log in to a registry
  resolve     Print files with resolved image references to digests.
  run         A variant of `kubectl run` that containerizes IMPORTPATH first.
  version     Print ko version.

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for ko
  -v, --verbose   Enable debug logs

Use "ko [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

From here you can use `ko build --help` or `ko apply --help` to get more information about the subcommands which is convenient.

### Autocompletion

Setup auto completion for your shell in few seconds: `ko completion --help` and follow instructions for your shell and os.

I use zsh on macOS so my flow was:

```sh
$ ko completion --help
$ ko completion zsh --help
$ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
$ source <(ko completion zsh)
$ ko completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_ko
```

A few seconds of setup to gain better productivity and less typos.

## How we use `ko`?

### Build the Image Locally

Handy for a quick sanity check to see if a simple build works and if the code can compile.

```sh
$ ko build ./cmd/app --push=false
...
ko.local/app-2cb05dc2132b0f81c2982cca8f717157:f1cd233a86cc3173e8b94f8a144
a4423abf369f9944406349e72acf103099a38
```

#### importpath

The `./cmd/app` part is the "importpath".

This is where you tell `ko` where it can find the package with `func main()`. If you have a mono repo with multiple apps and multiple main functions, you can specify which one you want to build this way.

If your `main.go` is in the root, you can omit it and just run `ko build --local`.

The import path should be relative, so `./cmd/app` and NOT ~~`cmd/app`~~

#### --push=false

`ko build` is like `docker build` + `docker push`. Confusing, I know. By setting `--push=false` we told it to just build the image so we know it works, but not be bothered with figuring out which repository to use and attempting to push there.

#### Makefile

We added this to our Makefile:

```Makefile
build:
    ko build ./cmd/app --push=false
```

This is a replacement `go build` command, which also verifies `ko` integration + keep you filesystem clean.
If the code doesn't compile, `make build` will fail without needing to setup or publishing anything.

### Publishing to ECR

Keyval's cluster runs on EKS which is an aws managed k8s service. We chose to use ECR - Amazon Elastic Container Registry to store our docker images.

#### Create ECR Repository

```sh
$ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-app
```

You should get back a json response with the repository details, and `repositoryUri` which looks like this: `012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app`. You can also find it in the ECR console.

#### Login to ECR

```sh
$ aws ecr get-login-password --region YOUR_REGION | docker login --username AWS
--password-stdin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URI
```

This works if `aws cli` is setup and you have the right permissions.

### Build and Publish to ECR

```sh
$ KO_DOCKER_REPO=012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app ko build --bare ./cmd/app
```

#### KO_DOCKER_REPO

`KO_DOCKER_REPO` is how you tell `ko build` where to push the image after it was built.

For ECR, you can find it in ECR web console, or get it with cli: `aws ecr describe-repositories` or just construct it based on the pattern.

#### --bare

Without this flag, `ko` will attempt to push the image as `012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app/app-2cb05dc2132b0f81c2982cca8f717157:latest` which includes the package name and hash, and is not supported by ECR. The --bare flag tells `ko` to push the image as `012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest` which is what we want.

For other registries, explore the `--bare`, `--base-import-paths` and `--tags` flag.

#### Test published image

Test image build + publish + pull + run locally:

```sh
$ docker run -p 8080:80 $(KO_DOCKER_REPO=012345678901.dkr.ecr
.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app ko build --bare ./cmd/app)
```

### Deploy to Kubernetes

In our k8s resource `.yaml` files, we populate the `image:` field with a `ko://` url, and then use `ko apply -f k8s --bare`.

#### `ko apply`

This is the same as running `kubectl apply` but with some extra magic. Before the resources are applied to the cluster, `ko` will search for import paths starting with `ko://` build the images, push them to the registry, and update the `image:` field in the resource `.yaml` files with the resolved image name and tag.

#### ko://

We are using a string like `ko://github.com/keyval-dev/auth/cmd/app` where `ko://` is the prefix, `github.com/keyval-dev/auth` is the module path as ko picked up from our `go.mod` file, and `cmd/app` is the import path to the package with `func main()`.

If you have multiple ko urls, it should work out of the box, applying ko build and replacing the image name everywhere it is found.

#### -f

This is the directory we want to apply to our cluster, the same directory we would use with `kubectl apply -f`.

## `ko` in CI/CD

We use github actions for our CI/CD. We run `ko build` on pull requests to verify we can build the project (no compile errors or missing dependencies), and run `ko apply` on each merge to main to build, push and apply the k8s Deployment with the new artifacts.

### Verify Build

This is our workflow file in `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

```yaml
name: 'build service'
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build-service:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.21.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: make install

      - name: Setup ko
        uses: ko-build/setup-ko@v0.6

      - name: ko build
        run: ko build ./cmd/app --local --push=false
```

### Deploy to Production

This is our workflow file in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

env:
  AWS_REGION: 'us-east-2'
  ECR_REGISTRY: '012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com'
  ECR_REPOSITORY: 'YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME'
  CLUSTER_NAME: 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  deply-service:
    name: Deploy Service
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: configure aws credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::012345678901:role/github-actions-deploy-service
          role-session-name: my-service-deploy
          aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}

      # The following command will update the kube config file with our cluster information.
      # It will use the credentials exported by the previous action.
      - name: Update KubeConfig
        shell: bash
        run: |
          aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ${{ env.CLUSTER_NAME }} --region=${{ env.AWS_REGION }}

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.21.x'

      - uses: ko-build/setup-ko@v0.6
        env:
          KO_DOCKER_REPO: ${{ format('{0}/{1}', env.ECR_REGISTRY, env.ECR_REPOSITORY) }}

      # ko uses https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper
      # to automatically login to ECR. no need to `ko login` or `docker login`

      - run: ko apply -f k8s --bare
```

In the above example, we used OpenID Connect to get temporary credentials for our github workflow to run specific commands in aws. [more info here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services). For this to work we added the `permissions:` part and the `role-to-assume` and `role-session-name` in the `configure-aws-credentials` step.
