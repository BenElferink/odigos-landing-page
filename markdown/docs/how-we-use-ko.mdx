In this blog post, we will describe how and why we setup the `ko` build tool to deploy our Go microservices in our Kubernetes cluster.

# Prerequisites

- `ko` is a tool for golang applications.
- `ko` is relevant if you are using docker containers to run your code.
- `ko` is especially handy if you are using kubernetes to deploy your containers.

I will not explain ko from the begining, there are plenty of resources online for that. 
I assume you are already familiar with the basics of `docker`, `ko`, and deploying to your environments.
This blog post is not a tutorial, but rather a description of how we use `ko` in our stack as reference for others who might want to do the same.

# Why `ko`?

At Keyval, the company behind [Odigos](https://odigos.io/) we deploy our cloud service using the following stack:
- microservices written in golang. 
- `Kubernetes` in `EKS` - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service.

`ko` gives us the following benefits:
- No need to write and maintain Dockerfiles
- Images following best practices, more secure, smaller in size and contains minimal dependencies.
- Integrates well with our kubernetess workflow - just one simple command to:

  - **Build** images
  - **Push** them to our private repository in ECR
  - **Update** the relevant "image:" values in our k8s manifest `.yaml` files
  - **Apply** them to our cluster

These requirements and workflow is very common, allowing us to simplify our CI/CD pipeline and reduce the amount of code we need to maintain.

# Useful Tips

## Links

- [Install `ko` CLI](https://ko.build/install/)
- [Docs](https://ko.build/)
- [Github repo](https://github.com/ko-build/ko)
- [Github action for CI](https://github.com/ko-build/setup-ko)
- [Recommended Getting Started blog post](https://snyk.io/blog/container-images-simplified-with-google-ko/) by snyk

## Sanity - Verify Installation

```sh
$ ko version
```

Should produce an output, signaling `ko` cli is installed and working, plus a chance to make sure the version is not too old.

## Search Online

As `ko` means a lot of things online, I always google or chat-gpt `ko build` (instead of just `ko`). 

For example, use "`ko build getting started`" instead of just `ko getting started`.

## CLI Help

Like most prefetional cli tools, you can find a lot of information in the CLI help without switching context to the browser or touching your mouse.

```
$ ko version
0.14.1
$ ko
Rapidly iterate with Go, Containers, and Kubernetes.

Usage:
  ko [flags]
  ko [command]

Available Commands:
  apply       Use resolved references in input files for image digest application.
  build       Build and publish container images from the given import paths.
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  create      Generate input files with resolved image references.
  delete      See "kubectl help delete" for detailed usage.
  help        Help about any command
  login       Log in to a registry
  resolve     Print files with resolved image references to digests.
  run         A variant of `kubectl run` that containerizes IMPORTPATH first.
  version     Print ko version.

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for ko
  -v, --verbose   Enable debug logs

Use "ko [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

From here you can use `ko build --help` or `ko apply --help` to get more information about the subcommands.

## Autocompletion

Setup auto completion for your shell in few seconds: `ko completion --help` and follow instructions for your shell and os.

I use zsh on macOS so my flow was:

```sh
$ ko completion --help
$ ko completion zsh --help
$ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
$ source <(ko completion zsh)
$ ko completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_ko
```

A few seconds of setup to gain better productivity and less typos.

# How we use `ko`?

## Build the Image Locally

I start with a simple sanity check to make sure `ko` is able to build the image locally and the code compiles.

```sh
$ ko build ./cmd/app --push=false
...
ko.local/app-2cb05dc2132b0f81c2982cca8f717157:f1cd233a86cc3173e8b94f8a144
a4423abf369f9944406349e72acf103099a38
```

We also use it in the CI to verify build on each PR push.

Let's break down the command:

### importpath

The `./cmd/app` part is the "importpath".

This is how instruct `ko` where it can find the go package with the `func main()`. We have a mono repo with multiple apps and multiple main functions, so we specify which one we want ko to build.

If your `func main()` is in the project root (next to `go.mod`), you can omit the importpath and just run `ko build --push=false`.

The import path should be relative, so `./cmd/app` and NOT `cmd/app`

### --push=false

`ko build` is like `docker build` + `docker push`. Confusing, I know. 

We use `--push=false` so `ko` build the image, but skip pushing it to a docker registry. `ko` is not bothered with figuring out which repository to use and attempting to push there.

## Makefile

```Makefile
build:
    ko build ./cmd/app --push=false
```

This is a replacement for `go build` command, which also verifies `ko` integration + keep you filesystem clean.

If the code doesn't compile, `make build` will fail without needing to setup or publishing anything.

## Publishing to ECR

Keyval's cluster runs on EKS which is an AWS managed k8s service. 

We chose to use ECR - Amazon Elastic Container Registry to store our docker images.

This section describes how to use `ko` with `ECR`, but the same principles apply to other registries and can be easily adapted.

### Create ECR Repository

```sh
$ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-app
```

You should get back a json response with the repository details, and `repositoryUri` which looks like this: `012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app`. You can also find it in the ECR console.

### Login to ECR

```sh
$ aws ecr get-login-password --region YOUR_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URI
```

This works if `aws cli` is setup and you have the right permissions.

### Build and Publish to ECR

```sh
$ KO_DOCKER_REPO=012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app ko build --bare ./cmd/app
```

Lets break down the command:

### KO_DOCKER_REPO

`KO_DOCKER_REPO` is how you tell `ko build` where to push the image after it was built.

For ECR, you can find it in ECR web console, or get it with cli: `aws ecr describe-repositories` or just construct it based on the pattern.

### --bare

Without this flag, `ko` will attempt to push the image as `012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app/app-2cb05dc2132b0f81c2982cca8f717157:latest` which includes the package name and hash (`app-{hash}` part), and is not supported by ECR.

ECR, dockerhub and possibly other registries only support images with the format `{registry}/{repository}:{tag}` where the repository is not nested (no `/` in the name).

The --bare flag tells `ko` to push the image as `012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest` which is what we want.

I also find this long name not very user friendly and prefer to use `--bare` and control the name myself.

For other registries, explore the `--bare`, `--base-import-paths` and `--preserve-import-paths` flag.

### Test published image

Useful command to test image build + publish + pull + run locally:

```sh
$ docker run -p 8080:80 $(KO_DOCKER_REPO=012345678901.dkr.ecr
.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app ko build --bare ./cmd/app)
```

## Deploy to Kubernetes

In our k8s Deployment `.yaml` files, we populate the `image:` field with a `ko://` url, and then use `ko apply -f k8s --bare`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  ...
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-service
          image: ko://github.com/odigos-io/my-app/cmd/app
```

- The `ko://` scheme is a special url that `ko` will recognize and replace with the resolved image name and tag.
- The `github.com/odigos-io/my-app` part is identical to the `module` field in our `go.mod` file.
- The `cmd/app` part is the import path to the package with `func main()`.

You can have multiple `ko://` urls in the same file, and `ko apply` will build push and replace all of them.

### `ko apply`

This is the same as running `kubectl apply` but with some extra magic. 

Before the resources are applied to the cluster, `ko` will search for import paths starting with `ko://` build the images, push them to the registry, and update the `image:` field in the resource `.yaml` files with the resolved image name and tag.

### -f

This is the directory we want to apply to our cluster, the same directory we would use with `kubectl apply -f`.

# `ko` in our CI/CD

We use github actions for our CI/CD. 

### Verify Build

We run `ko build` on pull requests push to verify we can build the project (no compile errors or missing dependencies).

This is our workflow file in `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

```yaml
name: 'build service'
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build-service:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.21.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: make install

      - name: Setup ko
        uses: ko-build/setup-ko@v0.6

      - name: ko build
        run: ko build ./cmd/app --local --push=false
```

### Deploy to Production

We run `ko apply` on each merge to main to branch to push and apply the k8s Deployment with the new artifacts.

This is our workflow file in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

env:
  AWS_REGION: 'us-east-2'
  ECR_REGISTRY: '012345678901.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com'
  ECR_REPOSITORY: 'YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME'
  CLUSTER_NAME: 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'

# AWS authentication is required to push to ECR and update the cluster
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  deply-service:
    name: Deploy Service
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: configure aws credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::012345678901:role/github-actions-deploy-service
          role-session-name: my-service-deploy
          aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}

      # The following command will update the kube config file with our cluster information.
      # It will use the credentials exported by the previous action.
      - name: Update KubeConfig
        shell: bash
        run: |
          aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ${{ env.CLUSTER_NAME }} --region=${{ env.AWS_REGION }}

      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.21.x'

      - uses: ko-build/setup-ko@v0.6
        env:
          KO_DOCKER_REPO: ${{ format('{0}/{1}', env.ECR_REGISTRY, env.ECR_REPOSITORY) }}

      # ko uses https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper
      # to automatically login to ECR. no need to `ko login` or `docker login`

      - run: ko apply -f k8s --bare
```

In the above example, we used OpenID Connect to get temporary credentials for our github workflow to run specific commands in aws. [more info here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services). 
For this to work we added the `permissions:` part and the `role-to-assume` and `role-session-name` in the `configure-aws-credentials` step.
